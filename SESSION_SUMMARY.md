# SESSION_SUMARY.md

## Sprint 1: Foundational Scaffolding

**Objectives:**
- Create `enhancements/` directory at repo root.
- Implement import-path override to shadow original code.
- Set up plugin-hook architecture for third-party extensions.

**Completed in This Session:**
- Mapped the entire FaceFusion codebase into `facefusion_directory_tree.txt` as our baseline restore point.
- Defined the `enhancements/` workflow: patch bundles, tests, patch logs, and import-shadowing mechanics.
- Established the session-context ritual using `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` to maintain continuity.

**Next Steps (Sprint 1):**
1. Scaffold the `enhancements/` folder structure, mirroring only the modules we’ll override.
2. Create `enhancements/__init__.py` to prepend `enhancements/` to `sys.path`.
3. Add a minimal plugin-hook entrypoint under `enhancements/facefusion/extension/`.
4. Initialize a CI pipeline (e.g. GitHub Actions) that enforces TDD and runs our pytest suite on every push.

**Open Questions:**
- Do you prefer `sys.path` manipulation or a custom import hook for shadowing modules?
- What naming/numbering convention should we use for patch bundles (e.g. `01-batch-ui`, `02-memory`…)?
- Which CI runner environments (Linux, Windows, macOS) do you need supported first?

## Continuity Rituals

- **Prefix every assistant response and generated file with `#remember`.**  
  This flag tells us we’re in an active session and no reset has occurred.

- **If a response is missing `#remember`,** immediately paste the contents of this file into the chat with the prompt:  

so the assistant can re-sync.

- **After each file is fixed or feature is delivered,** append a new checkpoint entry below with date, description, and link (if any).
